Congratulations! You're inside a screen session!
Here's your flag:
pwn.college{UlSC0XLenTooRtIRU6Wnq2H6nwm.0VN4IDOxwSMwEzNzEzW}
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~launching-screen:~$
```
### Steps

I started a screen session to create a persistent terminal environment. After entering the session, I confirmed I was inside a screen instance and the challenge printed the flag from within that session.

### What I Learned

I learned how to launch and enter a screen session, which gives me a detachable, persistent terminal that continues running even if I disconnect. This is useful for long-running tasks and for keeping programs alive between logins.

man screen

## 2. Detaching and attaching
```
screen
/challenge/run
screen -r
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~detaching-and-attaching:~$ echo Yes! Flag is: pwn.college{Ex4JvfLnR91EVfsg9zWOg_D1E1x.0lN4IDOxwSMwEzNzEzW}
Yes! Flag is: pwn.college{Ex4JvfLnR91EVfsg9zWOg_D1E1x.0lN4IDOxwSMwEzNzEzW}
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~detaching-and-attaching:~$
```
### Steps

I launched a screen session and then detached from it so the session continued running in the background. Later I reattached to the same session and observed the running programâ€™s output, which included the flag.

### What I Learned

I learned how to detach from a screen session to leave processes running and how to reattach later to regain interactive control. This reinforced the workflow for maintaining persistent interactive workspaces.

yeah my overconfident ass had to watch yt tutorials to do ts this time

## 3. Finding sessions
```
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~finding-sessions:~$ screen -ls There are screens on: 158.pts-0.terminal-multiplexing~launching-screen (Remote or dead)
147.pts-0.terminal-multiplexing~detaching-and-attaching (Remote or dead)
144.session_edcad0a4776b591d (Remote or dead)
147.session_ffb3d04b28b8a1d0 (Remote or dead)
150.session_72f18355bb971ed1 (Remote or dead)
144.session_10dc83fcb6364c8d (Detached)
147.session_0fe960d9a41d6481 (Detached)
150.session_2d526b417d9827c9 (Detached)
8 Sockets in /home/hacker/.screen.
screen -r 144.session_10dc83fcb6364c8d
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~finding-sessions:~$  echo 'Congratulations! You found the right session!'
Congratulations! You found the right session!
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~finding-sessions:~$  echo pwn.college{kGfbBfIPTa1yFuV5wPbITfaVUPc.01N4IDOxwSMwEzNzEzW}
pwn.college{kGfbBfIPTa1yFuV5wPbITfaVUPc.01N4IDOxwSMwEzNzEzW}
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~finding-sessions:~$ /challenge/run
```
### Steps

I listed active screen sessions to discover detached or running sockets. I identified the correct session by name/ID, attached to it, and located the message that revealed the flag.

### What I Learned

I learned how to enumerate screen sockets and sessions, how to interpret the listing output, and how to pick and attach a specific session. This is valuable when multiple sessions exist on the same host.

## 4. Switching windows
```
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~switching-windows:~$ screen -ls
There are screens on:
        158.pts-0.terminal-multiplexing~launching-screen        (Remote or dead)
        147.pts-0.terminal-multiplexing~detaching-and-attaching (Remote or dead)
        144.session_edcad0a4776b591d    (Remote or dead)
        147.session_ffb3d04b28b8a1d0    (Remote or dead)
        150.session_72f18355bb971ed1    (Remote or dead)
        144.session_10dc83fcb6364c8d    (Remote or dead)
        147.session_0fe960d9a41d6481    (Remote or dead)
        150.session_2d526b417d9827c9    (Remote or dead)
        135.challenge_session   (Detached)
9 Sockets in /home/hacker/.screen.
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~switching-windows:~$ screen -r 135.challenge_session
 cat <<MSG

hacker@terminal-multiplexing~switching-windows:~$ 
```
### Steps

Inside a screen session, I switched between numbered windows to locate content hidden in a different window. I followed the prompt to switch to the indicated window and found the flag printed there.

### What I Learned
I learned that terminal multiplexers support multiple windows inside a session and that each window can contain separate processes or shells. Mastering window switching (by index) helps to organize work and find outputs that are intentionally placed in other windows.

## 5. Detatching and Attatching (tmux)
```
tmux
ctrl+b d
/challenge/run
tmux attach
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~detaching-and-attaching-tmux:~$  echo Congratulations, here is your flag: pwn.college{YmW-yZSTusRIUNck_85X2RHT1Lv.0VO4IDOxwSMwEzNzEzW}
Congratulations, here is your flag: pwn.college{YmW-yZSTusRIUNck_85X2RHT1Lv.0VO4IDOxwSMwEzNzEzW}
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~detaching-and-attaching-tmux:~$ 
```
### Steps

I used tmux to create a session, detached from it to allow the program to keep running, and then reattached to the session to inspect the output. The challenge printed the flag after I reattached.

### What I Learned

I learned the equivalent tmux workflow for creating persistent sessions, detaching, and attaching. While conceptually similar to screen, tmux has different default keybindings and configuration options; both are valuable tools for session persistence.

man tmux
## 6. 
```
tmux ls
tmux attach
ctrl+b 0
 cat <<MSG

hacker@terminal-multiplexing~switching-windows-tmux:~$ 
```
### Steps

Within a tmux session I enumerated windows and used the appropriate key combo to switch to the target window. The flag was hidden in a different window and was revealed once I switched to it.

### What I Learned

I learned how tmux manages multiple windows within a session and how to navigate between them using tmux keybindings. This reinforced the general multiplexing concept that sessions can host multiple independent, switchable windows.
