Pondering Paths

The challenge asks you to navigate the Linux filesystem in the pwn.college DOJO and invoke programs using both absolute and relative paths from various directories. Each level tests your understanding of paths and how the shell resolves them.

1. The Root

Flag: pwn.college{AA2pAsID85BLWutqCKuxEAyw9Rb.QX4cTO0wSMwEzNzEzW}

We start at the root directory / and directly invoke the /pwn program using its absolute path. Since the program is at the root, this immediately works.

hacker@paths~the-root:~$ cd /.
hacker@paths~the-root:/$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{AA2pAsID85BLWutqCKuxEAyw9Rb.QX4cTO0wSMwEzNzEzW}

2. Program and Absolute Paths

Flag: pwn.college{UXIk7d2JnwElTFSN4Chd9GjTANC.QX1QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

We run /challenge/run using the absolute path from any directory. Absolute paths start with / and specify the exact location of a file in the filesystem.

hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{UXIk7d2JnwElTFSN4Chd9GjTANC.QX1QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

3. Position Thy Self

Flag: pwn.college{A7-WmhT03MDybBQUn243Mb5ZMds.QX2QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

Some programs require you to be in a specific directory to run them correctly. Here, /challenge/run must be executed from /usr/include. Using cd to move to the required directory allows the program to succeed.

hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/$ cd /usr/include
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/usr/include$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{A7-WmhT03MDybBQUn243Mb5ZMds.QX2QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

4. Position Elsewhere

Flag: pwn.college{IybSF15qIcv-viUKFLLA7iICh1X.QX3QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

Here, the correct directory is /var/log. Navigating to the correct location is necessary even when using an absolute path.

hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:/var/log$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IybSF15qIcv-viUKFLLA7iICh1X.QX3QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

5. Position Yet Elsewhere

Flag: pwn.college{wZGvKyaDQFnKsVqFsfMwPxm56-8.QX4QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

Similarly, this program requires /sys/kernel as the working directory.

hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:/sys/kernel$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wZGvKyaDQFnKsVqFsfMwPxm56-8.QX4QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

6. Implicit Relative Paths, From /

Flag: pwn.college{sfVVQoyFBEaujGlCWa9lg9DOJLp.QX5QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

Relative paths do not start with /. When invoking challenge/run from /, the shell resolves it relative to the current directory.

hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ challenge/run
Correct!!!
challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{sfVVQoyFBEaujGlCWa9lg9DOJLp.QX5QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

7. Explicit Relative Paths, From /

Flag: pwn.college{YkED61aHtR8hZDhLA274BsvXfre.QXwUTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

Here, we explicitly use ./ to indicate the current directory when running the program.

hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ ./challenge/run
Correct!!!
./challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{YkED61aHtR8hZDhLA274BsvXfre.QXwUTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

8. Implicit Relative Path, From /challenge

Flag: pwn.college{0biTFhyRqU33WL81WtlaGGICuaO.QXxUTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

After cding into /challenge, we can run the program with ./run to invoke it relative to the current directory.

hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Correct!!!
./run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0biTFhyRqU33WL81WtlaGGICuaO.QXxUTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

9. Home Sweet Home

Flag: pwn.college{UGcBbhZxiKzFr3t6naobo285_ph.QXzMDO0wSMwEzNzEzW}

Programs can accept arguments that specify file paths. Here, ~/f indicates the file should be written to the hackerâ€™s home directory.

hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/f
Writing the file to /home/hacker/f!
... and reading it back to you:
pwn.college{UGcBbhZxiKzFr3t6naobo285_ph.QXzMDO0wSMwEzNzEzW}
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ cat ~/f
pwn.college{UGcBbhZxiKzFr3t6naobo285_ph.QXzMDO0wSMwEzNzEzW}

What I Learned

I learnt how Linux resolves absolute vs relative paths, and the importance of the current working directory when running programs. I also practiced using cd effectively, the significance of ./ for relative paths, and how programs can accept arguments to write or read files in specific locations.

References
