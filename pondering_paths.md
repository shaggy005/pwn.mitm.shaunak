# Pondering Paths Challenge - Writeup

The challenge asks you to navigate the Linux filesystem in the **pwn.college DOJO** and invoke programs using both absolute and relative paths from various directories.  
Each level tests your understanding of paths and how the shell resolves them.

## 1. The Root

**Flag:**  
`pwn.college{AA2pAsID85BLWutqCKuxEAyw9Rb.QX4cTO0wSMwEzNzEzW}`

We start at the root directory `/` and directly invoke the `/pwn` program using its absolute path.

```bash
cd /.
/
pwn
2. Program and Absolute Paths
Flag:
pwn.college{UXIk7d2JnwElTFSN4Chd9GjTANC.QX1QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

Absolute paths start with / and specify the exact location of a file in the filesystem. We can run /challenge/run from any directory.

bash
Copy code
/challenge/run
3. Position Thy Self
Flag:
pwn.college{A7-WmhT03MDybBQUn243Mb5ZMds.QX2QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

Some programs require you to be in a specific directory to run them correctly. Here, /challenge/run must be executed from /usr/include.

bash
Copy code
cd /usr/include
/challenge/run
4. Position Elsewhere
Flag:
pwn.college{IybSF15qIcv-viUKFLLA7iICh1X.QX3QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

This time, the correct working directory is /var/log. Even though weâ€™re using an absolute path, the program checks where weâ€™re running it from.

bash
Copy code
cd /var/log
/challenge/run
5. Position Yet Elsewhere
Flag:
pwn.college{wZGvKyaDQFnKsVqFsfMwPxm56-8.QX4QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

Similarly, this program requires /sys/kernel as the working directory.

bash
Copy code
cd /sys/kernel
/challenge/run
6. Implicit Relative Paths, From /
Flag:
pwn.college{sfVVQoyFBEaujGlCWa9lg9DOJLp.QX5QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

Relative paths do not start with /. When invoking challenge/run from /, the shell resolves it relative to the current directory.

bash
Copy code
challenge/run
7. Explicit Relative Paths, From /
Flag:
pwn.college{YkED61aHtR8hZDhLA274BsvXfre.QXwUTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

Using ./ explicitly tells the shell to run a program from the current directory instead of searching the PATH.

bash
Copy code
./challenge/run
8. Implicit Relative Path, From /challenge
Flag:
pwn.college{0biTFhyRqU33WL81WtlaGGICuaO.QXxUTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

After moving into /challenge, we can run the program relative to the current directory with ./run.

bash
Copy code
cd /challenge
./run
9. Home Sweet Home
Flag:
pwn.college{UGcBbhZxiKzFr3t6naobo285_ph.QXzMDO0wSMwEzNzEzW}

Programs can accept arguments that specify file paths. Here, ~/f indicates the file should be written to the hackerâ€™s home directory.

bash
Copy code
/challenge/run ~/f
cat ~/f

Now it will render exactly as intended: Markdown headings + nicely highlighted `bash` code blocks.  

Do you also want me to **make the flags collapsible with `<details>`/`<summary>`**, so they donâ€™t clutter the page unless clicked?

Ah! I see now â€” in your original writeup, you had the full shell prompts and outputs for every command, not just the commands themselves. You want all of that included in GitHub Markdown, properly formatted with code blocks. Here's the fully corrected version including everything from your original prompt:

## 1. The Root

**Flag:**  
`pwn.college{AA2pAsID85BLWutqCKuxEAyw9Rb.QX4cTO0wSMwEzNzEzW}`

We start at the root directory `/` and directly invoke the `/pwn` program using its absolute path. Since the program is at the root, this immediately works.

```bash
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ cd /.
hacker@paths~the-root:/$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{AA2pAsID85BLWutqCKuxEAyw9Rb.QX4cTO0wSMwEzNzEzW}
2. Program and Absolute Paths
Flag:
pwn.college{UXIk7d2JnwElTFSN4Chd9GjTANC.QX1QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

Absolute paths start with / and specify the exact location of a file in the filesystem. We can run /challenge/run from any directory.

bash
Copy code
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{UXIk7d2JnwElTFSN4Chd9GjTANC.QX1QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}
3. Position Thy Self
Flag:
pwn.college{A7-WmhT03MDybBQUn243Mb5ZMds.QX2QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

Some programs require you to be in a specific directory to run them correctly. Here, /challenge/run must be executed from /usr/include.

bash
Copy code
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/$ cd /usr/include
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/usr/include$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{A7-WmhT03MDybBQUn243Mb5ZMds.QX2QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}
4. Position Elsewhere
Flag:
pwn.college{IybSF15qIcv-viUKFLLA7iICh1X.QX3QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

The correct working directory is /var/log. Navigating to the correct location is necessary even when using an absolute path.

bash
Copy code
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:/var/log$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IybSF15qIcv-viUKFLLA7iICh1X.QX3QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}
5. Position Yet Elsewhere
Flag:
pwn.college{wZGvKyaDQFnKsVqFsfMwPxm56-8.QX4QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

This program requires /sys/kernel as the working directory.

bash
Copy code
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:/sys/kernel$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wZGvKyaDQFnKsVqFsfMwPxm56-8.QX4QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}
6. Implicit Relative Paths, From /
Flag:
pwn.college{sfVVQoyFBEaujGlCWa9lg9DOJLp.QX5QTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

Relative paths do not start with /. When invoking challenge/run from /, the shell resolves it relative to the current directory.

bash
Copy code
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ challenge/run
Correct!!!
challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:

7. Explicit Relative Paths, From /
Flag:
pwn.college{YkED61aHtR8hZDhLA274BsvXfre.QXwUTN0wSMwEzNzEzW}

Using ./ explicitly indicates the current directory when running the program.

bash
Copy code
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ ./challenge/run
Correct!!!
./challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:

bash
Copy code
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/f
Writing the file to /home/hacker/f!
... and reading it back to you:
pwn.college{UGcBbhZxiKzFr3t6naobo285_ph.QXzMDO0wSMwEzNzEzW}

hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ cat ~/f
pwn.college{UGcBbhZxiKzFr3t6naobo285_ph.QXzMDO0wSMwEzNzEzW}
